## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: ``vi, vim, emacs``

* Your programs and functions will be compiled with ``gcc 4.8.4`` using the flags ``-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic``
* All your files should end with a new line
* Your code should use the ``Betty`` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)

Our ``main.c`` files might be different from the one shown in the examples.
