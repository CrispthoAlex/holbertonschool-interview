## Tasks

| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| [0. Prime Game](./0-prime_game.py) | Maria and Ben are playing a game. Given a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including n, they take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from the set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game.

They play x rounds of the game, where n may be different for each round. Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally, determine who the winner of each game is. |

<ul>
<li>Prototype: <code>int *find_substring(char const *s, char const **words, int nb_words, int *n);</code>, where

<ul>
    <li>Prototype: <code>def isWinner(x, nums)</code></li>
    <li>where <code>x</code> is the number of rounds and <code>nums</code> is an array of <code>n</code> </li>
    <li>Return: name of the player that won the most rounds</li>
    <li>If the winner cannot be determined, return <code>None</code></li>
    <li>You can assume <code>n</code> and <code>x</code> will not be larger than 10000</li>
    <li>You cannot import any packages in this task</li>
</ul>
