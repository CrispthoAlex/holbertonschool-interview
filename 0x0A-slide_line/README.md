# 0x0A. 2048 (single line)

## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: ``vi, vim, emacs``
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with ``gcc 4.8.4`` using the flags ``-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic``
* All your files should end with a new line
* Your code should use the ``Betty`` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* In the following examples, the ``main.c`` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own ``main.c`` files at compilation. Our ``main.c`` files might be different from the one shown in the examples.
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called ``slide_line.h``
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded


### Tasks

| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| [0. Slide line](./0-validate_utf8.py) | The goal of this task is to reproduce the [2048 game(NSFW !!)](https://play2048.co/) mechanics on a single horizontal line.

Given an array of integers, we want to be able to slide & merge it to the left or to the right. Identical numbers, if they are contiguous or separated by zeros, should be merged. |
